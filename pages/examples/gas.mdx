# Gas

## How much <ColoredText text="KLAY" color="#e74c3c"/> do you need to pay for a transaction?

You pay ```gas spent * gas price``` amount of <ColoredText text="KLAY" color="#e74c3c"/>, where

- <ColoredText text="gas" color="#e74c3c"/> is a unit of computation
- <ColoredText text="gas" color="#e74c3c"/> spent is the total amount of gas used in a transaction
- <ColoredText text="gas" color="#e74c3c"/> price is how much ether you are willing to pay per gas

Transactions with higher gas price have higher priority to be included in a block.

Unspent gas will be refunded.

## Gas Limit
There are 2 upper bounds to the amount of gas you can spend

- <ColoredText text="gas limit" color="#e74c3c"/> (max amount of gas you're willing to use for your transaction, set by you)
- <ColoredText text="block gas limit" color="#e74c3c"/> (max amount of gas allowed in a block, set by the network)
